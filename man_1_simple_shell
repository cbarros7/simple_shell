.SH SYNOPSIS

Mr. Robot the user can have the experience in an interactive and non-interactive way. On the one hand, if it is invoked with a standard input that is not connected to the terminal, Mr. Robot reads and executes the received commands in order. 

To use the Mr. Robot interactive mode use \fB isatty(3)\fR. Immediately the user will see a warning \fI$ \fR indicating that our shell is ready to read the command. 

On the other hand, in non-interactive mode the user will enter command line arguments, so \fB Mr. Robot\fR treats the first argument as a file from which to read the commands.
In interactive mode, you can type commands from the keyboard:

$ ./hsh
$ /bin/ls

In non-interactive mode, you can pipe commands into the program using echo or cat:

Non-interactive:
$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
$ cat file_name | ./hsh

.SH BUILTIN COMMANDS:
.B env
prints the environment
